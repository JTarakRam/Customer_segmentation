# Customer Segmentation

## **Overview**

This project mainly focuses on the customer segmentation system for retail business using demographic information. The desired outcome is to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics so that we can find potential customers, leading to improvements in sales and revenue for the company.

## **Motivation**

Customer segmentation is essential in every business because it helps segment customers into groups so that we can focus on potential customers. It also helps us identify low-performing areas so that we can improve them. In this competitive market, personalizing marketing strategies is vital to improve customer satisfaction and increase revenue, it follows the STP Framework where segmentation, targeting, and positioning you can know more about customer segemention in the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation) page.

## **Success Metrics**

The main goal here is to increase sales, identify potential customers, and provide personalized recommendations, discounts, reduce marketing costs, areas of improvement, customer retention, and conversion rates.

## **Requirements & Constraints**

Functional Requirements - The system must be able to analyze demographic information and create customer segments, and integrate the results into the business's marketing strategy.

Non-Functional Requirements - Performance, scalability, and data privacy.

## **What's in-scope & out-of-scope?**

The main scope is customer segmentation, which divides customers into groups based on their characteristics. By interpreting the results and filling the pitfalls, we can come up with personalized business marketing strategies that lead to increased sales and revenue.

Out of scope - Data warehousing, recommendation engine based on these clusters.

## **Methodology**

### **Problem Statement**

The problem is to find customer segments based on their characteristics and provide insights into personalized marketing strategies to increase sales.

### **Data**

The dataset includes demographic information such as age, gender, income, and spending. These are the main features that we need to perform customer segmentation.

### **Techniques**

Here, we can use machine learning techniques such as clustering algorithms (K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.), decision trees. In data cleaning and feature engineering, we may do scaling, normalization, outlier removal, etc.

### **Experimentation & Validation**

Clustering models will be validated using metrics such as silhouette score or within-cluster sum of squares. A/B testing will also be used to validate the effectiveness of segmentation.

### **Human-in-the-loop**

Human intervention is needed to validate the accuracy of segmentation and exclude customers from specific marketing strategies.

### **Implementation**

**Data —> Data Cleaning —> Pre-process —> Model —> Clusters —> Insights —> Marketing strategies based on insights(campaigns) —> Customers.**

### **Infra**

The system can be hosted on a local or cloud-based server. If it goes into production, we will host it in the cloud to ensure reliability and scalability.

### **Performance (Throughput, Latency)**

The system will be designed to meet the throughput and latency requirements and scale horizontally and vertically as needed.

### **Security**

The data is protected with a key, and we ensure that only authorized users can access customer data.

### **Data privacy**

We will ensure the privacy of customer data, and our system will handle it with privacy and security.

### **Monitoring & Alarms**

The system is always monitored by performance metrics such as error rates, latency, and alarms will be set up to alert the team if any issues happen.

### **Cost**

The estimated cost will depend on the scalability of the system, and the cloud-based services will include deployment.

For data collection, the cost is zero.

### **Integration points**

The system will integrate with upstream data sources such as customer data and downstream users such as marketing teams.

### **Risks and uncertainties**

There are some risks such as biased data collection, data quality and model performance, and customer adoption, but we can overcome them with proper strategies.

## **Appendix**

### **Alternatives**

There are some alternatives, we can use the decision tress and neural networks or we can use rule based segmentation and rmf-based segmention etc. Here we are using some machine learning based clustering algorithms such as k-means clustering, becuase it can capture the relationships and provide accurate and effective segmentation.

### **Experiment Results**

we conducted an experiment on customer segmentation on customer demographics and validated the system and our model were able to accuratly segment the customers based on the demographics of the customer.

### **Performance benchmarks**

we can ran some performance to measure the latency, throughput and instance size/count.

### **Milestones and Timeline**

The timeline is for this project is 4 days 

+ data collection, cleaning - 1 day

+ pre-precessing and modeling - 1 day

+ evaluation, and testing - 1 day 

+ deployment - 1 day


### **Glossary**

- Customer segmentation: It is the process of dividing the customers into groups based on the similar charecterstics.
- A/B testing: It is the method that is used to compare the performace or sales by chaging some features, like diving the data into control group and experiment group, based on the results, the team take the decisions.
- Throughput: performance testing is ****pinning down how many requests your software can take on per second, minute, or even hour
- Latency: Latency is the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from source to a destination.
